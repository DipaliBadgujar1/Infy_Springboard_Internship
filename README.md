The Sales Performance Analysis Dashboard provides an interactive visualization of sales metrics, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions. Key insights include sales growth, customer segmentation, product categories, and transaction history.

**Project Tasks**

1.Analysis of Project Requirements
2.Dataset Collection
3.Working with the Dataset using DAX Formulas
4.Customer Segmentation using DAX Data Transformation

**Tasks Breakdown**

***Task 1: Requirement Analysis***
Analyze the requirements and objectives for building the Sales Performance Dashboard.

Identify key insights and metrics such as sales growth, customer segmentation, product categories, and transaction history.

***Task 2: Dataset Collection***
Collect a relevant sales dataset including:
Sales Orders: Order ID, Quantity, Price, etc.

Customer Information: Customer ID, Customer Name, demographics.
Product Details: Product categories and descriptions.

The dataset should ideally be in CSV or database format for easy importing into Power BI.

***Task 3: Working with the Dataset in Power BI using DAX***

Steps to Import and Transform Data:
Data Source: Import the dataset (CSV file or database) with Sales Order, Customer Information, and Product Details.

Load Data: Use Power Query to load and preprocess the data.

Combine Datasets: Merge different datasets (e.g., Sales Order and Product Category) into a single table.

Transform Data: Apply transformations like filtering, sorting, and manipulation as necessary.

***Task 4: Customer Segmentation using DAX Data Transformation***

Steps for Customer Segmentation:
Data Source: Import a dataset with fields like CustomerID, Customer Name, Transaction Dates, Sales Amount, and Product Categories.

Data Transformation: Load customer transaction data and create calculated columns in Power Query Editor.

DAX Calculations and Measures

Total Sales Calculation:
Total Sale = Quantity * Price

Year-over-Year Growth:
YoY Growth = SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Total Sales)

Average Order Value:
Average Order Value = Total Sales / Order Count

Customer Segmentation:
Customer Expense = IF(Total Spend > 3800, "Platinum", IF(Total Spend > 1000, "Gold", "Silver"))

**Tools and Technologies**

Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For calculated columns, measures, and data transformation.

Power Query Editor: To load, clean, and transform data from raw sources.

**Future Improvements**

Implement predictive analytics for customer purchasing trends.

Automate data updates and dashboard refresh to include real-time insights.

Expand customer segmentation criteria for targeted marketing insights.



Milestone 2: 
 Module 2: Basic Visualizations

Objective: Create fundamental visualizations to represent sales data.

Tasks:

Create a clustered column chart to compare sales across different regions.

Use a line chart to show sales trends over time.

Create a pie chart to represent the sales distribution across product categories.

 Module 3: Advanced Sales Analysis

Objective: Use advanced features to analyze sales performance.

Tasks:
Create a measure to calculate Sales Growth Rate using DAX.

Implement a waterfall chart to analyze the contribution of each region to overall sales.

Add slicers to filter data by region, product category, and time period.

Milestone 4: 

Module 4: Final Dashboard and Presentation

Objective: Compile all visualizations into a final dashboard.

Tasks:
Arrange visuals on the dashboard to create a cohesive view of sales performance.

Add interactive elements such as tooltips and bookmarks to guide users through the analysis.

Prepare a presentation to explain insights derived from the dashboard, focusing on key sales trends and actionable recommendations.
